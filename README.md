# artificial-intelligence
Repository containing the projects produced during the Artificial Intelligence course at Aalto University.

The modules include the following projects:
* [Problem Solving with State-Space Search](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/knightsmove-exercise)
* [A* algorithm implementation](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/astar-exercise)
* [Encoding logic formulas using the z3 module](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/z3warmup-exercise)
* [Sudoku solver via constraint-based solver](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/sudoku-exercise)
  * Building a sudoku solver can also be formulated as a learnable problem. In this other [repo](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/master/graph-neural-network/7_gnn.ipynb), I implement a recurrent relational network that learns to solve sudoku puzzles.
* [Knight, Knave, Spy logic puzzle solver](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/knightsknaves-exercise)
* [Zebra logic puzzle solver](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/zebrapuzzle-exercise)
* [Computing Conditional Probabilities & Reasoning with Bayesian Networks](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/cpt-bayes-exercise)
* [Markov chain and Value Iteration](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/mdp-exercise)
* [Q-learning applied to Markov Decision Processes](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/qlearn-exercise)
* [Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/games-exercise)
* [Monte Carlo Search](https://github.com/albertonietos/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/games-exercise)
